Fixed Deposit Calculator – Flutter Project

1. Project Overview

This project has been developed using Flutter as part of academic coursework requirements. It implements a Fixed Deposit (FD) Calculator and demonstrates integration of a public REST API.

The application allows users to enter deposit amount, annual interest rate, and period (in months) to calculate the interest earned and total maturity amount. Additionally, it integrates a public REST API to fetch JSON data and display it dynamically using a ListView.


2. Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

* To implement user input handling using Flutter widgets
* To perform financial calculations using Dart
* To integrate a public REST API into a Flutter application
* To parse JSON data received from the API
* To display dynamic data using ListView

3. Technologies Used

* Flutter
* Dart
* HTTP package (for API integration)
* JSONPlaceholder REST API

4. Features

* Fixed Deposit interest calculation
* Display of total maturity amount
* REST API integration using HTTP package
* JSON data parsing
* Dynamic data display using ListView

5. API Used

The following public REST API was used for demonstration purposes:

[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts)

This API returns JSON data, which is parsed and displayed in the application.
